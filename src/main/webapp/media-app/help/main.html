   <div class="header">Q: After I have cleared out the ingest source field or the image file name field, and clicked on "Save", the value in field has appeared again, is it a bug?</div>
   <p>
     A: As long as there is matching video/image file name in the s3 bucket for the episode, the field will always be filled in. If you think the video or image file is not correct,  the file should be renamed.

   <div class="header">Q: Does Programme get imported from Schedule?</div>
   <p>
     A: Yes.     
   </p>
   <hr>
   <div class="header">Q: Does the PRogramme Group get automatically created or is this manually added?</div>
   <p>
     A: The app creates the programme collection with the same title as the programme or will be added to the "Default Series Group".  
     You need to modify the programme collection title to the correct one, the programme that has the same programme collection will be joined together into the same  collection automatically.

<div class="header">Q: How do we reconcile against existing data in Brightcove against Box Media App (will it over-write)?
</div>
   <p>
     A: Whatever entered in the Box Media app, if not left blank, will overwrite the data in the Brighcove. 
     For example, if you wish the images in the Brightcove should stay, then you should not specify the image in the Box Media app. 
      If you wish the Synopsis in the Brightcove to be kept as it is then you should left synopsis field blank in the Box Media app.
       But ideally it is not recommended to scatter around the master data all around in different systems, it is a maintenance nightmare you know.
       There is a button "Import images from brightcove" in the Box Media app, so you can import images from the Brightcove, there will soon a button called "Import everything" so you can import everything from brightcove.

<div class="header">Q: If Availability window is left blank, does this mean it is available indefinitely?
</div>
   <p>
    A: Yes, the logic is the same as Brightcove, but you know if there is schedule records for that record, then the availability window will be calculated from the schedules...
